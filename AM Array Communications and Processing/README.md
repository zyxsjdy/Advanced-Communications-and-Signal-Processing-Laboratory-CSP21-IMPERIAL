# array-communications-and-processing

This experiment is concerned with a compact examination of the relevant concepts and provides a tutorial mechanism regarding array processing techniques with main objectives to: 

- estimate the number of the emitting sources;  
- provide complete information about the directions of the emitting sources; 
- investigate the use of an array of sensors for detecting and rejecting in-band interferences; 
- estimate relative powers, cross-correlations, etc.
